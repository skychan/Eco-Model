  Abstract                 = {The decision to accept or reject an order should consider levels of finished goods and work-in-process inventories, as well as the smooth utilization of capacity. Most firms' order entry processes tacitly accept all orders. However, accepting orders without considering their possible costly impact on capacity can mean the firm is paying for the privilege of accepting an order. Demand management (DM) allows managers to be more effective in accepting or rejecting an order. DM's 3 essential steps are: 1. receipt and accumulation of orders, 2. order prioritization, and 3. capacity allocation. Prioritizing objectives means the manager must fully consider the firm's objectives in satisfying demand and utilizing capacity. Capacity allocation involves deciding in what part of the production schedule to put an order. An example of DM is provided.},

task division be automation level 

In order to flow manufacturing requirements from the cloud to automated resources, industrial control systems (ICSs) will also be required, which should do the monitoring and controlling resources at the shop floor level to ensure multi-resource cooperation. The ICS will coordinate and distribute tasks among manufacturing locations, ensuring compatibility of efforts and final products.
