\begin{abstract}
In the Cloud Manufacturing Ecosystem, a benign mode and methodology for massive services schedule is
required, in order for the collaboration within the whole Industry Chain. This paper studied the data of the
resources and services and modeled the services scheduling problem in the chain. With the Big Data
analysis on the Cloud Platform, optimal assessment/schedule methods were developed, which could
gradually evolve the ecosystem to an optimal situation.
