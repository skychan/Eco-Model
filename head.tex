\begin{abstract}
In cloud manufacturing, platform operator is able to manage distributed massive manufacturing resources for manufacturing business.
Cloud manufacturing ecosystem has more complicated relationship among individuals than that in existing manufacturing system, every individual makes decisions depend on enriched information. In this paper, an original operation mode with three extensions namely incubation, outsourcing and metabolism mode are proposed. We designed an agent-based simulation model and the validation experiment result shows platform have: 1) shorter job queue length and lower resource idle rate with incubation mode; 2) a little shorter job queue length and fewer amount of registered resource with outsourcing mode; 3) the fewest amount of registered resource but a little higher resource idle rate with metabolism mode.
