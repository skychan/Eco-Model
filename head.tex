\begin{abstract}
In cloud manufacturing, individuals engage in manufacturing business through a well-designed platform, where the operator is able to manage distributed massive manufacturing resources.
Cloud manufacturing ecosystem has more complicated relationship among individuals in it than that in normal manufacturing system, one individual can make decisions depend on the surroundings and others'. In this paper, we designed an original operation mode with 3 extensions named incubation, outsourcing and metabolism for the ecosystem. We designed an agent-based simulation model to validate the effectiveness of these modes. Experiment result shows evolution in ecosystem: with incubation mode, the job queue length is reduced and the resource idle rate is declined; with outsourcing mode, the job queue length is also reduced but not as much as that with incubation mode and more resource is required; with metabolism mode, lower resource is required than that with other modes and resource idle rate just rose up a little.
