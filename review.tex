In cloud manufacturing context, platform operator can manage  manufacturing service that encapsulated with distributed manufacturing resources intensively with appropriate business model\cite{Xu2012}, modular approaches and multi-layer architectures are the most common approaches to build the cloud manufacturing platform or system framework\cite{Tao2012,Valilai2013}, Lv use list of views to depict this multi-layer architecture\cite{LvJuly312012-Aug.22012}. 

Servitization is the key philosophy to operate cloud manufacturing\cite{li2010cloud}, service can be created statically which come along with provider\cite{Tao2012} or can be created dynamically according to task pattern, such method as `Multi-Composition for Each Task'\cite{Liu2013} that combines incompetent service into a whole, service can also be created by AI planning-based automatic composition framework\cite{OhJan.-March2008}. 

Simulation approach have been widely used in manufacturing system on operations planning and scheduling, real-time control, operating polities, performance analysis\cite{Smith2003}. In operating policies field, scheduling policies can be tested with simulation performance under given machine conditions\cite{Sabuncuoglu2003}, machine
segmentation policies can be simulated in a combined MRP and Kanban production system\cite{Felberbauer9-12Dec.2012}. Mourtzis et al.\cite{Mourtzis2015} explored a series of simulation-based solutions in industrial practice and considered that research trends are Internet and cloud based situation.
