% This definition is quite abstract and thus despite its corretness not very useful.
from \textbf{function, resource}, information, process view to depict the cloud manufacturing platform.

Currently, the literature review indicates that modular approaches and multi-layer architectures are the most common way to build the cloud manufacturing platform or system framework (Tao, Zhang, et al. 2012;Valilai and Houshmand 2013)

\subsection{Manufacturing Ecosystem} % (fold)
\label{sub:manufacturing_ecosystem}
% xx of an ecosystem is a path-dependent, chaotic process, which means that a small difference in starting values can cause great difference to result.

% From a bionomic perspective, organisms and organizations are nodes in networks of relationships. As time passes and evolution proceeds, some nodes are wiped out and new ones crop up, triggering adjustments that ripple across each network. 
\subsubsection{Different Ecosystem Analogies}

\subsubsection{Manufacturing System}
% Constrained by its key relationships, each organism and each organization is held in its niche, pursuing the same goal -- the genetic or technological information it carries.

% coevolved to form a vast living ecosystem

% 4 different stages for ecosystem:
% birth, expansion, leadership, final(self-renew or death)

% the major difference between ecological and social system is the role of conscious choice.

% Accoring to xxx there are three critical success factors of a business ecosystem.
% First, productivity
% Second, Robustness
% Third, have the ability to create niches and opportunities for new firms.

% Complexity relevant concepts

% Self-organization
% Emergence
% Coevolution
