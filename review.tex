from \textbf{function, resource}, information, process view to depict the cloud manufacturing platform.

In cloud manufacturing context, centralized management for manufacturing services that encapsulated with distributed manufacturing resources can be realized by an appropriate business model\cite{Xu2012}

Currently, the literature review indicates that modular approaches and multi-layer architectures are the most common way to build the cloud manufacturing platform or system framework (Tao, Zhang, et al. 2012;Valilai and Houshmand 2013)

\textbf{Services and Tasks}

Cloud Manufacturing Ecosystem provides a platform which distributed manufacturing resources/orders gathered as resources/orders hub. In order to complete orders precisely, order will be splited into tasks. Similarly, resources will be bundled into services for the quick searhing.

\textbf{Roles}

Most recent studies like Wu et al.\cite{Wu2013} described the roles in Cloud Manufacturing as a tri-group model with:\begin{inparaenum}[1)]
\item Users/Customers,
\item Application providers and
\item Physical resource providers.
\end{inparaenum}
However, the roles in real world always not go like this model, since it parted roles only by their functions. While, users could get different function roles depend on what transaction they take, we should make some modifiacations on this model.

% xx of an ecosystem is a path-dependent, chaotic process, which means that a small difference in starting values can cause great difference to result.

% From a bionomic perspective, organisms and organizations are nodes in networks of relationships. As time passes and evolution proceeds, some nodes are wiped out and new ones crop up, triggering adjustments that ripple across each network.
\subsubsection{Different ecosystem analogies}
