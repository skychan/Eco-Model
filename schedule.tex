\section{Resources Scheduling} % (fold)
\label{sec:model}

In order to properly accomplish the proposed tasks with optimal allocation of the manufacturing resources, a series of methodologies were combined to assist the resources scheduling process in Cloud Manufacturing Ecosystem.

Most of the related methodologies can be archived into \textbf{four} main modules, namely \textit{Decision Making Support}, \textit{Rating Schema}, \textit{Recommand System} and \textit{Matching Regulation}, which are going to explained in detail respectively.

The scheduling effect can be estimated and observed through \textit{Service Dashboard}, which also provides the control function that will help the evolution in the Ecosystem.
