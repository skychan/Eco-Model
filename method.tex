\label{sec:methodological_approach}

This section starts with a brief overview of ABMS. Then .... Finally ... 
i.e. the swarm model of the system.

In a word, the center of the research is the design of the user agent, and the core of the agent is to make decisions. so the core of the evolution is to make decision? 

core of the paper: agent simulation, decision making.

\subsubsection{Assumptions and notation}
\begin{itemize}
    \item one provider can publish only one order at one time;
    \item service quality give the initial rank, the product quality depends on the service quality, review depends on the service quality, and the rank depends on the review;
    \item when it comes to rank value, we refer two different rank values: user rank(provider) and service rank, their relationship should be determined.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Design philosophy} % (fold)
\label{ssub:design_philosophy}
platform create demander and provider
demander, a subclass of user, generate need i.e. create order (the defined task bunch)
    task is a subclass of job, need to be processed with specified resource type and amount(type,amount) , have its process time.
provider, a subclass of user, provider resource with different type and capacity, these resources can be allocated to task job and service-call job, service-call is subclass of job, which is the job to combined to create service.

the two type of job, task and service call, have something in common that need to be processd with resource. for task, the resource is renewable, for service-call, the resource is unrenewable.

service can be generated after the finish of service-call, so it belongs to the user who generate the service-call. service more like a contract

service-call come out driven by the task need, when a task appears frequently, provider proposed the job that have the same configuration. so the service generated by the service-call will suit for the specificed task.

good for service: efficieny, do not have to coordinated anymore, flexibe wile process with task, with the outsource trick, slice the taks, co-worked by all the useful resources.
bad for service: task-oriented, can only process specified task,

\label{ssub:main_flow_design}
\begin{itemize}
    \item generate provider and demander
    \item generate order (with task)
    \item generate resources
    \item process tasks (with only resource)
    \item organize service
    \item process task (plus service)
    \item Review and elimination of provider and service

for service provider to modify their service area, i.e. breadth and depth.

Decision making involves choosing some course of action among various alternatives. For a decision maker, fulfilling the con

\subsubsection{System Model}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Co-evolution
    \item Self-organization
    \item Emergence 
    \item Adaption
\end{itemize}

Assumptions:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item substitute transport with time consume
    \item manufacturing agent randomly show up in the map
\end{enumerate}

Co-evolution consist of:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Scarcity of customers
    \item Conscious choice that enables the organizations to change
    \item Interconnectedness of the enables the organizations to change
    \item Feedback processes that carry the long-term consequences of co-evolution
