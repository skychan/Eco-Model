  Abstract                 = {In this paper, we describe RanGen, a random network generator for generating activity-on-the-node networks and accompanying data for different classes of project scheduling problems. The objective is to construct random networks which satisfy preset values of the parameters used to control the hardness of a problem instance. Both parameters which are related to the network topology and resource-related parameters are implemented. The network generator meets the shortcomings of former network generators since it employs a wide range of different parameters which have been shown to serve as possible predictors of the hardness of different project scheduling problems. Some of them have been implemented in former network generators while others have not.},

  Abstract                 = {The decision to accept or reject an order should consider levels of finished goods and work-in-process inventories, as well as the smooth utilization of capacity. Most firms' order entry processes tacitly accept all orders. However, accepting orders without considering their possible costly impact on capacity can mean the firm is paying for the privilege of accepting an order. Demand management (DM) allows managers to be more effective in accepting or rejecting an order. DM's 3 essential steps are: 1. receipt and accumulation of orders, 2. order prioritization, and 3. capacity allocation. Prioritizing objectives means the manager must fully consider the firm's objectives in satisfying demand and utilizing capacity. Capacity allocation involves deciding in what part of the production schedule to put an order. An example of DM is provided.},

In order to satisfy high efficiency and low cost collaborative design task scheduling in CMfg, a new energy adaptive immune genetic algorithm (EAIGA) was designed. With the introduction of potential energy storage and detection, the new algorithm can not only improve searching diversity based on immune strategy, but also adaptively adjust the probabilities of crossover and mutation with low time complexity. The experimental results demonstrate that the new algorithm can effectively solving collaborative design task scheduling problem with a good balance between searching diversification and intensification.},

We develop three heuristic algorithms to solve large sized problems. Computational tests indicate that the proposed algorithms are both computationally efficient and effective even for instances up to 300 orders.},

task division be automation level 

In order to flow manufacturing requirements from the cloud to automated resources, industrial control systems (ICSs) will also be required, which should do the monitoring and controlling resources at the shop floor level to ensure multi-resource cooperation. The ICS will coordinate and distribute tasks among manufacturing locations, ensuring compatibility of efforts and final products.

  Abstract                 = {Architecture for grid manufacturing system was provided. The evolution of manufacturing mode and the naissance of grid manufacturing were analyzed, and the typical architecture for grid was introduced, they are the layered sandglass structure and the open grid service architecture (OGSA). Then we analyzed the scheme of grid manufacturing for Shaoxing spinning region, based on which, architecture for grid manufacturing system was proposed. The manufacturing grid architecture absorbed the five-level framework of grid and the grid services idea in OGSA, and integrated many supporting toolboxes and protocols of Globus, which is a helpful exploration to the development of grid manufacturing system.},
