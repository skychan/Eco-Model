  Abstract                 = {The decision to accept or reject an order should consider levels of finished goods and work-in-process inventories, as well as the smooth utilization of capacity. Most firms' order entry processes tacitly accept all orders. However, accepting orders without considering their possible costly impact on capacity can mean the firm is paying for the privilege of accepting an order. Demand management (DM) allows managers to be more effective in accepting or rejecting an order. DM's 3 essential steps are: 1. receipt and accumulation of orders, 2. order prioritization, and 3. capacity allocation. Prioritizing objectives means the manager must fully consider the firm's objectives in satisfying demand and utilizing capacity. Capacity allocation involves deciding in what part of the production schedule to put an order. An example of DM is provided.},
