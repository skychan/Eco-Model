\subsection{Roles}
Most recent studies like Wu et al.\cite{Wu2013} described the roles in Cloud Manufacturing as a tri-group model with:\begin{inparaenum}[1)]
\item Users/Customers,
\item Application providers and
\item Physical resource providers.
\end{inparaenum}
However, the roles in real world always not go like this model, since it parted roles only by their functions. While, users could get different function roles depend on what transaction they take, we should make some modifiacations on this model.

Before the emendation of the roles, some related standard name should be taken:
\begin{asparadesc}
\item[User] The main role in Cloud Manufacturing, which is combined of Seller and Buyer as shown in \tabref{tab:categoryuser}, usually acts as Seller or Buyer according to the specific transaction;
\item[Seller] The temporary role in a transaction, which provides the allocated part of manufacturing service and makes a evalution about the Buyer after the transaction;
\item[Buyer] The temporary role in a transaction, which submits the allocated part of manufacturing task and makes a evalution about the Seller after the transaction;
\item[Administrator] The role that gets the work for the operation and maintenance of the platform, has indirectly impact on the Ecosystem.
\end{asparadesc}
\begin{table}[htbp]
  \centering\small
  \caption{Category of Users}
    \begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{llccX}
    \toprule
        &  & Seller & Buyer & Description \\
    \midrule
    Generalized & User & $\surd$ & $\surd$ & Act as Seller or Buyer according to the specific transaction. \\
    Enterprise & User & $\surd$ & &  Provides the allocated part of manufacturing services and makes a evalution about the Buyer after the transaction. \\
    Customer & User& & $\surd$ &  Submits the allocated part of manufacturing tasks and makes a evalution about the Seller after the transaction.\\
    \bottomrule
    \end{tabularx}%
  \label{tab:categoryuser}%
\end{table}%
As defined above, Enterprise User is the special case of the User(short for Generalized User) that purely provides manufacturing servicesa and the Customer User is similarly defined.

Hence, there is only two roles in the Ecosystem worth to be studied: User and Administrator, the proportion of user type could be adjusted as the runtime of the system goes by.

\subsection{Operation Mode of Ecosystem}
The style the Cloud Manufacturing Ecosystem appears mainly depends on the way the operation mode takes, therefore, research on features and issues in the Ecosystem would be taken within the scope of operation mode we are going to set up. As shown in xxx, the struct of Ecosystem can be described like a tree ,  xiabibi...

Because the metioned system is too complex to analyse in every detail, we focus on two important parts -- Order flow and User status -- to help illustrate the Operation Mode.

\subsubsection{Order Flow}
simple order flow
\subsubsection{User Rank}
simple user rank

for these will be described detail in the simulation module.
\subsubsection{Platform}
