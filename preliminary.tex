\item Users
\item Application providers
\item Physical resource providers
\end{inparaenum}

But we take the part little different, ie prp is the generalize

\subsection{Operation Mode of Ecosystem}
The style the Cloud Manufacturing Ecosystem draws mainly depends on the way the operation mode takes, therefore, research on features and issues in the Ecosystem would be taken within the scope of operation mode we are going to set up. As shown in xxx, the Ecosystem consists of xxx,  xiabibi...

Because the metioned system is too complex to analyse in every detail, we focus on two important parts -- Order flow and User status -- to help illustrate the Operation Mode.

\subsubsection{Order Flow}

\subsubsection{User Status}

\subsection{Big-Data Tools}
