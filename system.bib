  Abstract                 = {For more than sixty years, markets and hierarchies have dominated people's thinking about economic organization. Markets, hierarchies, and ecosystems are the three pillars of modern business thinking and should provide the foundation for competition policy, regulation, and antitrust actions. The focus of companies in most sectors has progressed from competing on efficiency and effectiveness to competing on the basis of continuous innovation. Courts and regulators need to recognize the ecosystem form, appreciate its nature, structure, and operation, and seek to support its contributions to procompetitive and proinnovative social outcomes. The business ecosystem organizational form solves the problem of how to open up and extend a framework of modularity and participation. Markets facilitate transactions for goods. Hierarchies facilitate control over activities that produce goods. Ecosystems facilitate coordination of innovation in goods and the activities that produce them, as well as facilitate managed co-evolution of the complex web of markets and hierarchies themselves.},

The simulation-based technologies constitute a focal point of digital manufacturing solutions, since they allow for the experimentation and validation of different product, process and manufacturing system configurations. This article investigates simulation-based applications in a series of different technological and manufacturing domains. First, this article discusses the current industrial practice, focusing on the use of information technology. Next, a series of simulation-based solutions are explored in the domains of product and production process design, as well as in the area of enterprise resource planning. The current technologies and research trends are discussed in the context of the new landscape of computing hardware technologies and the emerging computing services, including the initiatives comprising both the Internet cloud and the Internet of things.},

The resulting software is capable of generating, simulating and evaluating a series of alternative assembly line configurations and is implemented as a cloud service, taking into account diverse market and manufacturing scenarios. The platform, which the discrete applications are based on, is a multi-agent system comprising different software agents, which assist engineers in the collaboration processes. Special focus is given to the problem of designing mixed-model assembly lines based on the existing engineering information with new calculations. A multi-agent framework and a common data repository are used for the integration of the stakeholders along the engineering chain. The proposed approach is demonstrated through an automotive case study.},

provide the theory and application of business ecosystems

Application:
1. Coevolution
 both entities have an effect on each other's success potential, which may induce change in some directions
 The decision that one organization makes can force or enable other organizations to make some other decisions.
 Pagie (1999) discusses three types of coevolution, namely competitive, mutualistic and exploitative.
 There are preconditions that need to be fulfilled in order to have meaningful coevolution. In Peltoniemi (2005b)
such preconditions consist of the following:
 1. Scarcity of customers that induces selection pressure;
 2. Conscious choice that enables the organizations to change;
 3. Interconnectedness of the organizations that enables the organizations to have an affect on each other;
 4. Feedback processes that carry the long-term consequences of coevolution
2. Self-organization in a business ecosystem
 self-organization is a process where “pattern and regularity emerge without
the intervention of a central controller
 the absence of a central or outside controller
3. Emergence in a business ecosystem
 the links between individual agent actions and the long-term systemic outcome are unpredictable
 The key to emergence is the link between micro and macro behavior
 emergence confuses the links between cause and effect, which makes it impossible for one actor to control the whole system

反应由外部和内部意识组成。

Emergence and self-organization are products of decentralized decision making in a sense that the system is more than the sum of its parts},

In order to flow manufacturing requirements from the cloud to automated resources, industrial control systems (ICSs) will also be required, which should do the monitoring and controlling resources at the shop floor level to ensure multi-resource cooperation. The ICS will coordinate and distribute tasks among manufacturing locations, ensuring compatibility of efforts and final products.
