The scenarios explored include technological improvements as well as structural changes in production systems and lifestyle changes. Many of such changes have long lead times, requiring up front and timely investments in infrastructure, innovative incentive structures and education. For simulating the scenarios we applied the IMAGE modelling framework, with a time horizon until 2050.},

The network generator meets the shortcomings of former network generators since it employs a wide range of different parameters which have been shown to serve as possible predictors of the hardness of different project scheduling problems.

Policy two implements common machine groups for both kinds of materials. A scalable production planning simulation model is applied which is set up by parameterization of the respective database without any model implementation work. For high set-up times and low number of items, we find that whenever utilization of the production system is high, the production system segmentation policy is preferable. However, for medium and low utilization values common machine groups perform best in all scenarios.

In a series of decade-long experiments in temperate grassland, Hautier et al. manipulated nitrogen, water, carbon dioxide, herbivory, and fire. In all cases, plant species diversity was important for preserving ecosystem function during environmental change. Hence, the preservation and restoration of biodiversity buffer ecosystems against anthropogenic assault.Science, this issue p. 336 Human-driven environmental changes may simultaneously affect the biodiversity, productivity, and stability of Earth{\textquoteright}s ecosystems, but there is no consensus on the causal relationships linking these variables. Data from 12 multiyear experiments that manipulate important anthropogenic drivers, including plant diversity, nitrogen, carbon dioxide, fire, herbivory, and water, show that each driver influences ecosystem productivity. However, the stability of ecosystem productivity is only changed by those drivers that alter biodiversity, with a given decrease in plant species numbers leading to a quantitatively similar decrease in ecosystem stability regardless of which driver caused the biodiversity loss. These results suggest that changes in biodiversity caused by drivers of environmental change may be a major factor determining how global environmental changes affect ecosystem stability.},

  abstract  = { Recently, cloud manufacturing has been generating a great deal of interest among both practical users and researchers. Multi-task oriented manufacturing cloud services composition and optimisation (MTO-MCSCO) is critical to the optimal allocation of manufacturing resources and capabilities in cloud manufacturing systems. However, if users鈥� QoS requirements on multi-functionality manufacturing tasks (MFMTs) are high enough, no competent composite services can be identified based on the concepts of the single-task oriented services composition and optimisation (STO-SCO) technique, which was previously in use, and the currently existing 鈥楨ach Composition for Each Task鈥� (ECET) pattern. To circumvent this, a 鈥楳ulti-Composition for Each Task鈥� (MCET) pattern based global approach is proposed to combine the incompetent composite services into a whole to perform each MFMT collectively, in order to ensure the success rate of QoS requirement fulfilment and the overall QoS outcome. This new issue of MTO-MCSCO with the MCET pattern is a more general problem than are the previous STO-SCO and the current ECET pattern. To formulate the problem, exterior aggregation patterns and formulas are proposed. To tackle the problem, a hybrid-operator based matrix coded genetic algorithm (HO-MCGA) is implemented. The experimental results indicate that the proposed MCET pattern based global approach significantly outperforms the previous approaches, and the proposed HO-MCGA is sound performance-wise. },

We develop three heuristic algorithms to solve large sized problems. Computational tests indicate that the proposed algorithms are both computationally efficient and effective even for instances up to 300 orders.},

Therefore, flexible composition of Web services to fulfill the given challenging requirements is one of the most important objectives in this research field. However, until now, service composition has been largely an error-prone and tedious process. Furthermore, as the number of available web services increases, finding the right Web services to satisfy the given goal becomes intractable. In this paper, toward these issues, we propose an AI planning-based framework that enables the automatic composition of Web services, and explore the following issues. First, we formulate the Web-service composition problem in terms of AI planning and network optimization problems to investigate its complexity in detail. Second, we analyze publicly available Web service sets using network analysis techniques. Third, we develop a novel Web-service benchmark tool called WSBen. Fourth, we develop a novel AI planning-based heuristic Web-service composition algorithm named WSPR. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments to verify WSPR against state-of-the-art AI planners. It is our hope that both WSPR and WSBen will provide useful insights for researchers to develop Web-service discovery and composition algorithms, and software.},

provide the theory and application of business ecosystems

Application:
1. Coevolution
 both entities have an effect on each other's success potential, which may induce change in some directions
 The decision that one organization makes can force or enable other organizations to make some other decisions.
 Pagie (1999) discusses three types of coevolution, namely competitive, mutualistic and exploitative.
 There are preconditions that need to be fulfilled in order to have meaningful coevolution. In Peltoniemi (2005b)
such preconditions consist of the following:
 1. Scarcity of customers that induces selection pressure;
 2. Conscious choice that enables the organizations to change;
 3. Interconnectedness of the organizations that enables the organizations to have an affect on each other;
 4. Feedback processes that carry the long-term consequences of coevolution
2. Self-organization in a business ecosystem
 self-organization is a process where “pattern and regularity emerge without
the intervention of a central controller
 the absence of a central or outside controller
3. Emergence in a business ecosystem
 the links between individual agent actions and the long-term systemic outcome are unpredictable
 The key to emergence is the link between micro and macro behavior
 emergence confuses the links between cause and effect, which makes it impossible for one actor to control the whole system

反应由外部和内部意识组成。

Emergence and self-organization are products of decentralized decision making in a sense that the system is more than the sum of its parts},

Moreover, we compare offline and online scheduling schemes in a dynamic manufacturing environment. The results of extensive simulation experiments indicate that the variable-time-response is better than the fixed-time-response. The full scheduling scheme generally performs better than the partial scheduling. Finally, the online scheduling is more robust to uncertainty and variations in processing times than the optimum-seeking offline scheduling.

This paper reports on work to develop guidelines for Material, Energy and Waste (MEW) process flow modelling to support the pursuit of sustainable manufacturing. Using qualitative MEW process flow maps of a case facility, data was collected to build a spreadsheet model aligned to each of the MEW process flows. The quantitative analysis provided detailed insight into the MEW process flows within the system and assisted with the identification and selection of environmental efficiency improvements. The key learning points from conducting the analysis generated a set of guidelines to aid the analysis of manufacturing systems, using MEW process flow modelling. This paper documents the approach developed and the environmental performance improvement opportunities identified in the case facility.},

The process of RSOS and composition is divided into the following five steps in MGrid-RSOSCF: (1) decomposing the submitted manufacturing task into several subtasks (i.e. single resource service requested task) if the submitted task is a multiple resource service requested task; (2) searching out the qualified resource service for each decomposed subtask and generating the corresponding candidate resource service set; (3) retrieving, evaluating and comparing the quality of service (QoS) for each candidate resource service, and provide data for service optimal-selection and composition 鈥搃f the submitted task is a single resource service requested task; (4) evaluating synthetically the overall quality of each candidate resource service and ranking them, and selecting the optimal one for the task 鈥� if the submitted manufacturing task is an multiple resource service requested task; (5) selecting one candidate resource service from each candidate resource service set and constructing a new composite resource service according to the submitted task requirements, and collecting all the possible resource service composite execution paths (RSCEP) and selecting the optimal paths to execute the task. The proposed MGrid-RSOSCF consists of five layers and each layer provides the corresponding necessary services and algorithms to address one problem mentioned above. The five layers are: (1) T-layer, responsible for MGrid task decomposition; (2) S-layer, responsible for resource service match and search; (3) Q-layer, responsible for QoS processing; (4) O-layer, responsible for evaluating and ranking the candidate resource service and (5) C-layer is responsible for resource service composition and optimal-selection. The case study and comparison of performances of the algorithms demonstrate that the proposed methods are sound on success rate and executing efficiency. },

  abstract  = {Today's manufacturing enterprises struggle to adopt cost-effective manufacturing systems. Overview of the recent manufacturing enterprises shows that successful global manufacturing enterprises have distributed their manufacturing capabilities over the globe. The successes of global manufacturing enterprises depend upon the entire worldwide integration of their product development processes and manufacturing operations that are distributed over the globe. Distributed manufacturing agents' collaboration and manufacturing data integrity play a major role in global manufacturing enterprises' success. There are number of works, conducted to enable the distributed manufacturing agents to collaborate with each other. To achieve the manufacturing data integrity through manufacturing processes, numbers of solutions have been proposed which one of the successful solutions is to use ISO 10303 (STEP) standard. However, adopting this standard one can recognize antonym effects of integration and collaboration approaches that weaken both integration and collaboration capabilities of manufacturing agents. In our latest work, we had developed an integrated and collaborative manufacturing platform named LAYMOD. Albeit the platform in question was through enough to be applied in various collaborative and integrated CAx systems, its embedded structure hampers its application for collaboration in distributed manufacturing systems. To achieve an integrated and collaborative platform for distributed manufacturing agents, this paper proposes a service-oriented approach. This approach is originated from cloud computing paradigm known as one of the technologies which enables a major transformation in manufacturing industry. Also, to maintain the product data integration based on the STEP standard, a new service-oriented approach is proposed. This approach is in parallel to the new capability of the STEP standard for supporting XML data structures. The result is a new platform named XMLAYMOD. XMLAYMOD is able to support distributed manufacturing collaboration and data integration based on the STEP standard. The different aspects of this platform to fulfill the requirements of distributed collaboration and also to overcome the lacks of the STEP standard are discussed through a brief case study.},

Coelho, The risk of delay of a project in terms of the morphology of its network, European Journal of Operational Research 119 (1999), 510鈥�537] and have been modified, or sometimes completely replaced, by alternative indicators to describe the network topology. The contribution of this paper is twofold. Firstly, we generate a large amount of different networks with four project network generators. Our general conclusions are that none of the network generators are able to capture the complete feasible domain of all networks. Additionally, each network generator covers its own network-specific domain and, consequently, contributes to the generation of data sets. Secondly, we perform computational results on the well-known resource-constrained project scheduling problem to prove that our indicators are reliable and have significant, predictive power to serve as complexity indicators.},

Cloud computing is emerging as one of the major enablers for the manufacturing industry; it can transform the traditional manufacturing business model, help it to align product innovation with business strategy, and create intelligent factory networks that encourage effective collaboration. Two types of cloud computing adoptions in the manufacturing sector have been suggested, manufacturing with direct adoption of cloud computing technologies and cloud manufacturing鈥攖he manufacturing version of cloud computing.

however, today's NM mainly refers to integation of distributed resources for undertaking a single manufacutring task.
lack of centeralized operation management of the services, choice of different operation modes and embedded access of manufacturing equipoment and resources, without which a seamless, stable and high quality transaction of manufacturing resource service cannot be guaranteed.

NM 缺乏资源提供者与资源需求者的协作(coordination)

cloud manufacturing reflects both the concept of "integration of distributed resources" and the concept of "distribution of integrated resources".

mirroring NIST's definition of cloud computing, cloud manufacturing may be defined as "a model for enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable manufacturing resources (e.g. manufacturing software tools, manufacturing equipment, and manufacturing capabilities) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction".

A cloud manufacturing service platform performs search, intelligent mapping, recommendation and execution of a service.

Manufacturing resource may take two forms: manufacturing physical resources and manufacturing capabilities.
MPR: can exist in the hardware and software form.
MC: intagible and dynamic resources representing the capability of an organization undertaking a particular task with competence.(product design, simulation, experimentation, management, maintenance...)},
