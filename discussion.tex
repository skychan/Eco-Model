\label{sec:contributions_limitations_and_future_research}
We only proposed 3 extension modes to combine and it may not fully describe the operation mode of the cloud manufacturing system, limited mode option may limit the evolution direction of the ecosystem, hence we will try to design more extension modes to test. The assignment of service-call is oversimplified to prevent complex consequence, we will design new method to assign this job. The job-lock problem may have better solutions.
