\section{Limitations, and Future Research} % (fold)
\label{sec:contributions_limitations_and_future_research}
We only proposed 3 extensions to combine and it may not fully describe the operation mode of cloud manufacturing system, it may also limit the evolution direction of the ecosystem, hence we will design more extensions. The assignment of service-call is oversimplified to prevent complex consequence, we will design new approaches to assign this job.
